Dry mouth and dry eyes are possible when using this strain, while other side effects are less likely. Chemdawg is most popular on the West Coast, in Nevada, and in Colorado.

It's perfectly common to experience feelings of laziness, happiness, and euphoria after smoking this strain of weed, which is why it's primarily used in the medical world to treat stress, pain, and insomnia.

It's an indica-heavy strain, though the exact ratio of sativa to indica isn't widely known.

That's much too low to recommend Paris OG as treatment for epileptics or other patients whose conditions require CBD. Instead, this strain is a useful means of treating depression, glaucoma and eye pressure, headaches, muscle spasms, and nausea. The full, heavy body high is calming and sleepy, so Paris OG is also good for insomnia, and it induces euphoria, happiness, and a tingly sensation. Expect a woody diesel smell with hints of flowers and pine needles, matched with a flavor of flowers, citrus, and pine. The nugs are huge and sticky. Negatives aren't commonly reported, but dry mouth and red eyes are usually the most likely.

Also, this strain is considered to be one among the high yielding plants. The sativa/indica ratio of this strain is found to be 60:40.

It has long been a favorite of stoners and medical marijuana patients here. Durban Poison has THC levels that can reach 24%, making it one of the world's more powerful strains.

Cannatonic has an earthy smell, with a woody citrus flavor. It's most popular in the Pacific Northwest, California, and Michigan. This strain is best for treating epilepsy and pain, as it provides a deep feeling of relaxation with uplifting cerebral effects. Cannatonic is a hybrid blend of MK Ultra, an indica, and the legendary G-13 Haze, an indica-dominant hybrid.

The aroma is surprisingly delicate, with a rich floral earthy smell that has only a hint of sweetness to it. Tutankhamen buds have large oversized Christmas-tree shaped forest green nugs with dark olive green leaves, thick purple hairs, and a super sticky layer of visible sweet resin. The Tutankhamen high is characterized by a stoney introspective cerebral state. You’ll be hit with an immediate onset of a cerebral head rush that numbs the mind and leaves you hazy and distant. A numbing body high will slowly overtake you, leaving you completely relaxed and helplessly couch-locked with a deep sense of spacey introspection.

Optimally, Pineapple Chunk will deliver a small dose of CBD with its crushing THC content, resulting in powerful painkilling and stress-relieving properties.

It shares their potency, with THC levels as high as 18-21%, which makes it a relatively strong – but not overpowering – tool for treating disease. As its name suggests, Grape Ape tastes and smells like sweet grapes, with a subtle berry flavor. Like its Purple ancestors, this strain develops a deep purple bud and leaves to go with its grape-like qualities. It's most useful in treating chronic pain, including migraines and arthritis, though it also helps relieve anxiety, depression, and PTSD. The high is profoundly relaxing, a full-body experience that can lead to strong couch-lock and deep sleep. This is definitely a nighttime strain, as it can have a near-comatose effect. But the high can also be euphoric and focused, with a clear mind. Dry mouth is common, as are red eyes. Most easily found on the West Coast, in Colorado, and in Michigan, this popular strain can also be purchased across the country, on both legal and black markets. It's a relatively easy strain to grow.","Grape Ape, propagated by Apothecary Genetics and Barney’s Farm, is a mostly indica strain that crosses Mendocino Purps, Skunk, and Afghani.

This highly addictive strain is massively potent, with top THC levels reaching 24%. It has a sativa/indica ratio of 65:35. The high is decidedly cerebral, with a big mood boost and a jolt of energy. This strain spurs creativity and helps patients get things done. It's most effective in treating anxiety and depression, along with ADHD, PTSD, and migraines. Green Crack has a sweet flavor with tropical and citrus notes. The buds are dense and tight. Dry mouth occurs frequently, while dry eyes, dizziness, and paranoia, happen less often. It's most common in the Pacific Northwester, California, Arizona, and Colorado. But it can be found almost anywhere else with relative ease. It's one of the most popular strains on the black market for this reason.","Don’t let the name fool you: this is pure cannabis.

The heavy sativa genes create a strongly euphoric, creative high with an upbeat mood. The effects are great in treating depression, anxiety, pain, and muscle spasms. Moby Dick can also alleviate lack of appetite. The overall effect is clear-headed but relaxing. The dominant smell and flavor when smoking Moby Dick is citrusy. This strain also has an earthy lemon taste and a sweet floral aroma. Dry mouth is the most common side effect, along with bloodshot eyes. Paranoia is also possible. Moby Dick is a relatively popular strain, available on several legal medical marijuana markets. It's probably easiest to find in Arizona, Colorado, and parts of Europe.

Platinum Kush gets its name from its frosty appearance, a result of the dense trichomes that grow on the bud. THC levels vary, but are usually in the 16%-18% range. That makes this a moderately strong choice, though poor growing can lead to very low THC levels. An indica, Platinum Kush has more CBD than most strains available in America. This chemical is used to treat severe seizures and other conditions. The combination of THC and CBD makes this a good strain for anxiety, depression, and pain, as the body high is deeply relaxing. This strain has a sweet, pungent smell reminiscent of fruit and a sweet, earthy taste. Platinum Kush, aka Platinum OG Kush and Platinum OG, is probably the result of crossbreeding between Master Kush and an original Afghani strain. Platinum Kush produces a mellow, easy feeling; the high doesn't last very long, but it's usually enough to put an insomniac to sleep.

It generally leaves its smokers with a feeling of euphoria, laziness and sleepiness. Some of the downsides of this strain is dry mouth, dry eye's and dizziness. Also, due to the potency of the aroma of the plant, it's not very good to carry around on you if you're trying to be low key. It's used medically for anxiety, stress, pain, insomnia, and depression.

70,sfv-og,hybrid,0.3,0.7,0.195,"SFV OG, also known as ""San Fernando Valley OG"" to many members of the cannabis community, is a potent sativa dominant (30% indica/70% sativa) phenotype of the OG Kush strain created by breeders at the infamous Cali Connection farms in the San Fernando Valley. This dank bud boasts an average THC level ranging from 17-22% and primarily indica effects. Users describe the SFV OG high as one with an almost immediate onset of relaxing and sedative effects that leave you feeling moderately couch locked with a light pressure in mind and body that is pain relieving. These effects are accompanied by a feeling of elevation and euphoria that is balanced by the deep indica effects. Due to these potent effects, SFV OG is an ideal strain for treating patients suffering from conditions such as mild to moderate cases of depression, chronic pain due to injury or illness, muscle spasms, and stress. SFV OG has an aroma of tangerines with a slight touch of diesel and a taste of citrusy pine with a sweet diesel aftertaste upon exhale. SFV OG buds have small dark army green nugs with olive green leaves, reddish brown hairs, and a fine layer of white trichomes and resin.","SFV OG by Cali Connection is a sativa-dominant hybrid that is great for patients who need strong pain relief but don’t want to be stuck on the couch. As the name indicates, this OG Kush relative originates from California’s San Fernando Valley. Although their names are barely distinguishable, SFV OG Kush is actually the Afghani-crossed child to SFV OG. The flowers will stay fairly small and may not look super impressive, but what it lacks in looks it makes up for in smell. The pine and lemon earthiness that SFV exudes can be a bit harsh and bitter if smoked, so this strain is one to save for the vaporizer if consuming directly.

85,og-kush,hybrid,,,0.215,"OG Kush is an American marijuana classic, a Southern California original with some of the highest THC levels in the world. With a 25:75 sativa/indica ratio, this strain pulls no punches. Expect a hard, mixed high with intense euphoria followed by serious couch-lock. The plant's THC concentration can reach levels as high as 19-24%. That just 1 percentage point less than the current record-holder. The cerebral boost from OG Kush is ideal for depression, bipolar disorder, and anxiety, while the heavy body high can help with pain and nausea. OG Kush is also used to treat Alzheimer's disease. Dry mouth and eyes are the most common negative effects, though headaches and paranoia are also possible. This strain is a hybrid, probably a descendant of a female Chemdawg plant and a male Hindu Kush plant. OG Kush, which has given rise to countless West Coast strains, has an earthy, wood taste and a strong pine scent. It's most popular in California, the Pacific Northwest, and Colorado.","OG Kush makes up the genetic backbone of West Coast cannabis varieties, but in spite of its ubiquity, its genetic origins remain a mystery. Popular myth maintains that Chemdawg and Hindu Kush parented OG Kush, passing on the distinct “kush” bud structure we see in many strains today. However, we can’t be sure because OG Kush first came from bag seed in the early 90s. The earliest propagators (now known as Imperial Genetics) are said to have brought the seeds out of Florida to Colorado and southern California, where it now flourishes. There are many different phenotypes of OG Kush, some of which include Tahoe OG, SFV OG, and Alpha OG. OG Kush is cherished for its ability to crush stress under the weight of its heavy euphoria. It carries an earthy pine and sour lemon scent with woody undertones, an aroma that has become the signature of OG Kush varieties and descendants. With OG Kush, patients most commonly cite improvements in migraines, ADD/ADHD, and stress disorders. ",,Earthy Pungent Sweet Spicy Herbal Lemon Pine Woody Earthy Pine Woody,"Body High Energizing Euphoria Happy Hungry Body High Energizing Euphoria Happy Hungry Relaxed,Happy,Euphoric,Uplifted,Sleepy",4.3,og-kush,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.00018181818181818183,0.011000000000000001,0.2619369369369369,0.0,0.003545454545454545,0.015545454545454545,0.0,0.7840347826086957,0.028866666666666662,0.0789304347826087,0.045636363636363635,1.0544869565217387,0.348208695652174,0.00018181818181818183,0.6329826086956524,0.3867739130434782,0.01,0.011565217391304346,0.1832,9.090909090909092e-05,0.0,18.75833333333333,2.1296932515337432,0.11500000000000002,19.666,0.012727272727272728,0.1144,0.26953125,0.13903508771929826,0.0,0.0,0.5151127819548871,0.21017241379310345,0.08525252525252519,12.025,156.0,2.0,9.0

The genetic history of this strain can be traced back to the Hindu Kush mountains; however, its complete history is almost unknown due to poor documentation. Bubba Kush is 100% indica, so you can anticipate a relaxing body high that will leave you couch locked. Many patients prefer this strain due to its ability to alleviate insomnia, depression, stress, and/or ADD/ADHD. Although Bubba Kush can relieve many ailments, it is not a daytime strain; that is unless you plan on sleeping your day away. Upon smoking, you will be introduced to an earthy and sweet taste accompanied by a piney scent. Bubba Kush has vivid green and purple buds that are coated in amber hairs. The abundance of trichomes makes this strain almost as sticky as bubblegum itself.","Bubba Kush is an indica strain that has gained notoriety in the U.S. and beyond for its heavy tranquilizing effects. Sweet hashish flavors with subtle notes of chocolate and coffee come through on the exhale, delighting the palate as powerful relaxation takes over. From head to toe, muscles ease with heaviness as dreamy euphoria blankets the mind, crushing stress while coercing happy moods. Bubba Kush exhibits a distinctive, bulky bud structure with hues that range from forest green to pale purple.Bubba’s stocky plant stature and bulky bud structure suggest Afghani descent, but its genetic origins aren’t certain. The breeder whom this strain was named after states that Bubba Kush emerged just after 1996, when an OG Kush hybrid pollinated an unknown indica strain obtained in New Orleans. The mother plant was supposedly Northern Lights, but the genetically ambiguous indica was simply called “Bubba.” Bubba Kush has flourished from its California roots ever since. ",,Earthy Coffee Sweet Kush Spicy Herbal Pungent Woody Earthy Sweet Woody,"Body High Cerebral Energizing Euphoria Happy Hungry Relaxing Body High Cerebral Energizing Euphoria Happy Hungry Relaxing Relaxed,Happy,Sleepy,Euphoric,Hungry",4.3,bubba-kush,,,,,,0.0,0.008125,0.2167777777777778,0.000125,0.005,0.026875000000000003,0.0,0.8961190476190476,0.0013636363636363635,0.03342857142857143,0.07649999999999997,1.2935952380952376,0.2710595238095238,0.0,0.5408928571428571,0.2608690476190476,,0.011630952380952384,0.19848809523809527,0.00025,0.0,17.962242990654218,0.999026548672566,0.021666666666666667,19.020000000000003,0.00375,0.05166666666666666,0.10314606741573032,0.1015,0.0,0.0,0.5080851063829787,0.12176470588235293,0.05399999999999997,,107.0,0.0,8.0

The effect is deeply relaxing, making this a good strain for treating PTSD, arthritis, migraines, and mood disorders. It can also help with insomnia and chronic pain.

Contrary to popular belief, Charlotte’s Web is a hemp-derived product with little to no psychoactive effects, making it great for those who don’t want their medication to affect their daily tasks.

As with most strains, the most likely adverse effects are dry eyes and dry mouth. Paranoia and dizziness are also possible but less common.

CBD levels, on the other hand, aren't widely reported; that means this strain generally shouldn't be used as the sole treatment for epilepsy or other conditions that respond to CBD. The high is cerebral and peppy, making this a good choice for daytime errands, social events, or creative endeavors. Use this strain to treat depression, chronic pain, stress, inflammation, and nausea. King Tut tastes like fresh fruit and flowers and has a sour, Skunky smell.

This infamous bud boasts an insanely high THC level that typically falls over 20% and a myriad of heavy nighttime effects. The high starts with an instant soothing narcotic effect felt in the head with a heavy sedative effect that leaves your mind pleasantly hazy with a sense of deep introspection and a lack of any mental pain or racing thoughts. These effects slowly spread into the body with a deeply relaxing and narcotic effect that leaves you very sleepy and completely pain-free with a sense of utter serenity and peace. Upon the comedown you’ll be almost immediately lulled into a deep and dream-free sleep that’s said to be falling victim to the black. Because of these heavy effects, The Black is perfect for treating conditions such as insomnia, nightmares, chronic pain, and muscle spasms or tremors. This bud has a smooth yet strong taste of earthy grape and an aroma of spicy mulled wine that has a delicious sweetness that’s released when the nugs are broken apart. The Black buds have medium-sized dense grape-shaped insanely dark purple nugs with black leaves, purple hairs, and a frosty thick coating of purple crystal trichomes and sweet sticky resin.","The Black is a strong 90% indica bred by BC Bud Depot. This strain dates back to the late 1980's, originating in California and on Vancouver Island in Canada.

The effects are calming and intensely euphoric, with happiness and a powerful case of the munchies. It's a versatile tool for treating anxiety, depression, inflammation, lack of appetite, migraines and other headaches, mood disorders, chronic pain, and insomnia. The sativa/indica ratio of this strain is hard to verify, but appears to be as low as 10:90, meaning strong physical effects. THC tests are scarce, but the few that are publicly available suggest fairly high potency, topping 20%. CBD levels are reportedly much lower, less than 1%, so this isn't an ideal choice for treating conditions that respond to that chemical, including epileptic disorders. The flavor and aroma of Pink Kush are similar, with notes of pine, wood, and flowers. The strain gets its name in part from the pink hairs that punctuate its green nugs.

You will have to wait it out until you feel the high overcome you. Once you start feeling relaxed, you will be at peace and will feel incredibly powerful. This is then followed by intense feelings of euphoria, which is primarily associated with Yeti OG.

This strain is popular in legal markets in the American West, less so in other regions. Though not exactly a top-shelf strain, Romulan rates well among users, and it's a favorite of many medical marijuana patients. It can be overpowering if used in high concentrations, with possible dizziness, paranoia, and headaches.","Romulan, named after the alien Star Trek race, is a powerful indica revered for its potent therapeutic qualities. Though mostly indica, Romulan growers insist sativa genetics have crept in over time, lending it intense cerebral effects. These squat, pine-scented plants produce dense frosty buds that have found their following among connoisseurs in British Columbia and the Pacific Northwest. A deep, sedating relaxation makes Romulan a favorite strain for patients treating muscle spasms and nerve damage.

Dry mouth is very common, but other adverse effects are limited. This strain is most popular in its home territory, British Columbia and Ontario, along with Colorado and the Pacific Northwest. It's much harder to find elsewhere. The cerebral high packs a major mood boost, with feelings of happiness and euphoria. It tends to promote energy and creativity, but there's also a mellow body effect that encourages relaxation.","Island Sweet Skunk, sometimes called Sweet Island Skunk, is a sativa strain that users enjoy for its energetic effects. The flavor is most easily described as “sweet skunk,” where tropical fruit flavors take the lead. Often the fruity aroma is likened to grapefruit.

Some varieties of Island Sweet Skunk have a heightened CBD content to help patients treating anxiety, inflammation, and muscle spasms. Flowering occurs at 7 to 8 weeks and buds will have bright yellow-orange hairs.

Also known as Hawaiian Banana, this strain has a brightly frosted green appearance with orange streaks. The effects combine a deep Kush body high with a clear, focused Hawaiian head high. It's best for treating moderate pain, lack of appetite, and insomnia. It can also relieve the symptoms of anxiety and depression. But good luck finding this rare strain. It's probably more popular in Hawaii and on the West Coast than elsewhere. For those lucky enough to come across this strain, be sure to mix this Hawaiian Mango with real mangos and see what happens.",,,Mango Fruity,Cerebral Happy Relaxing Cerebral Happy Relaxing,,bho-hawaiian-mango,,,,,,,,3.57,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,1.32,0.0,,1.92,0.62,,0.0,0.0,,,55.16,2.11,,,,,24.2,0.5,,,1.54,,0.1,,1.0,0.0,0.0

THC levels vary in Purple Nepal but appear to be quite high, topping 19% in some samples and regularly scoring about 18%. Those numbers mean this strain provides a particularly intense, indica-driven body high with deep physical relaxation, sleepiness, and powerful hunger balanced against creativity, arousal, and upbeat mood. As a result, Purple Nepal is a good strain for treating lack of appetite, inflammation, chronic pain, stress, insomnia, and depression. But it's probably much less effective in treating seizure disorders and other conditions that are alleviated with CBD, as that chemical is definitely in short supply in Purple Nepal. True to its name, this strain produces green and purple buds with brown hairs and generates an earthy grape flavor and smell. Dry eyes are common, and other side effects include cottonmouth, paranoia, dizziness, and limited headaches. Purple Nepal is relatively popular as purps strains go, and patients should be able to find it on the medical marijuana markets in California, Oregon, Washington State, Colorado, and, increasingly, Massachusetts.","Purple Nepal is a cross between an original Nepalese strain and Lemon Thai.

This bud is internationally recognized as one of the world’s strongest strains and users are often advised to use cautionary dosage control when using it.

The high is powerful in nature, with an almost immediate onset of a blissfully euphoric state that is heavy in the head, giving you droopy eyes and a spacey mind. As you get lost helplessly in your own disconnected thought, your body will slowly succumb to a creeping body buzz that weighs you down and leaves you helplessly sedated. This couch-locked state is very sleepy in nature, leaving you incredibly drowsy and most likely ending in deep and uninterrupted sleep. These effects and its insanely powerful THC level of 16-25% on average makes The Hog the perfect bud for treating conditions such as insomnia, chronic pain, inflammation, chronic stress or anxiety, and mild to moderate cases of depression. This bud has lumpy piecey medium-sized spade-shaped dark musty green nugs with sparse dark amber hairs and a super sticky coating of sweet syrupy resin. The Hog has a classic aroma of skunky earth with a spicy floral pungency that can be detected after the nugs are burned. The flavor is less harsh, with an earthy skunkiness that’s accented by pungent floral and sweet spice.","Originally bred by T.H. Seeds in Amsterdam, The Hog is regarded as one of the strongest strains in the world and won a High Times Cannabis Cup for the best indica in 2002. This strain is recognized by its pungent aroma, indicative of its world-renowned, extremely heavy body buzz. In fact, it is so potent that many advise cautionary dosage control.

Whatever its true parentage, LA Kush boasts a moderately high THC level between 19-21% and surprisingly cerebral effects. The onset has a uplifting cerebral effect that builds quickly, leaving you energized and motivated with a sense of focus and purpose. Although the high hits fast and hard, it is not accompanied by any anxiety or paranoia typical of a powerful sativa or sativa hybrid strain due to its heavy indica parentage. As the high continues you’ll be hit with a mellow body buzz that leaves you utterly relaxed and happy with full functionality and a perfect level of motivation. Because of these effects, LA Kush is ideal for treating chronic pain, inflammation, muscle spasms, and tremors. This bud has a deliciously minty aroma of fresh earthy pine and a taste of peppermint pine with a hint of fresh damp earth upon exhale.

The plant is featuring neon-green colored buds that would lately become resin-coated and snowy-white colored ones. They will be colored by fiery orange-colored hairs all over. Typically, the plant would grow like a vine with its weaker stems. This strain became more popular due to its taste and smell which are similar to fruit mixture. The taste of Vortex will have the traces of mango and lemon in addition to the spices and diesel fuel. The aroma will be fruity with the tropical punch. The THC content of this strain is nearly 18% with the CBD count of 0.59% and a CBN count of 0.8%. This high THC content of the strain could produce a two-hour high. Vortex is found to be a good afternoon strain which could relieve the patients from migraine.

547,dark-star,indica,,,0.19,"Dark Star, also known as DarkStar, is a pure indica (sativa/indica ratio of 0:100) that comes with relatively modest THC levels but several good medical uses. This strain is apparently the result of a cross between two popular originals, Purple Kush and Mazar-i-Sharif. Tests suggest THC levels can top 19%, putting this in the medium range as far as potency is concerned. The few available CBD tests show that chemical is scarce in this strain, too scarce to recommend Dark Star as treatment for epilepsy of other conditions that respond to CBD preparations. The indica genes in this strain produce a calming physical buzz with euphoria, happiness, and some limited cerebral effects. It's a good source of medicine for chronic body pain, everyday stress, and lack of appetite, as it can generate a powerful case of the munchies. The flavor and aroma of Dark Star both have strong, sweet notes of coffee and soil. There isn't much information on side effects, but patients should expect at least some of the usual culprits: dry mouth, dry eyes, paranoia, dizziness, and headaches. Available in both Europe and the United States, this strain sells best in Colorado, the Pacific Northwest, Arizona, Michigan, Spain, and the Netherlands.","Dark Star’s true indica effects are as spacey as its name suggests: a deep, relaxed sensation throughout the body accompanied by a heavy cerebral calm. Though celestial in its effects, the strain is more likely homage to the Grateful Dead’s song “Dark Star.” A cross between Purple Kush and Mazar-I-Sharif, Dark Star is a CBD-rich indica ideal for treating pain and anxiety. This dark--almost bluish--strain was first bred indoors by T.H. Seeds, and comes as a challenge to many growers with its slow, 10-week flowering period.

The effects start in the head and then move to the body. THC levels are very high, at least 21% in publicly available lab results. Surprisingly, then, CBD levels are also relatively high, between 1% and 2%. That means Purple Dragon may be useful in the treatment of seizure disorders and other conditions that respond to CBD. It's also recommended for treating anxiety, low mood, physical fatigue, inflammation, migraine headaches, mood disorders, chronic pain, and insomnia. Both the flavor and smell of this strain contain notes of flowers, sage, and spice, while the buds have a combination of purple, green, and orange hues. Dry mouth is the only widely reported negative effect from using Purple Dragon, though dry eyes, dizziness, and paranoia are also possible.

On the other hand, CBD levels are very low, far less than 1%, too low to recommend this as a good source of medicine for seizure disorders and other conditions that can be treated with CBD. But the calming high, a mix of both body and cerebral effects, is effective in alleviating anxiety, depression, muscle spasms, chronic pain, and insomnia. Though it's fine any time of day, Purple Rhino is most effective at night, inducing deep relaxation and strong couch-lock effects. The buds are light green in color, with purple and amber strands and a heavy coat of trichomes. This strain has a sweet, distinctive flavor of berries and citrus, with a similar aroma. Side effects aren't widely reported, but it's a safe guess that dry mouth is one of them. Bloodshot eyes and paranoia may also be possible.

The high, often quite strong, creates a happy case of the giggles, a tingly sensation, and a potent dose of euphoria. The aroma is sweet, as is the taste, with hints of flowers and honey. Rainbow gets its name from its multi-colored nugs, which are covered in a glossy layer of trichomes. It sells best on the legal medical markets in Arizona, California, Colorado, and Montana. It may also appear on the black market, but it isn't very common in most places. This strain may cause dry mouth and dry eyes, while paranoia and dizziness are also reported.","Rainbow is a 50/50 indica/sativa hybrid from Spanish breeders Lifetime Seeds, created by crossing Dancehall with Blueberry.  A compact, fast flowering strain with little side-branching, it does very well when grown in the “sea-of-green” style.

With a spicy-sweet fruity flavor, this tasty hybrid can give consumers a pleasant, creative high and pain relief without a heavy body sensation.  ",,Earthy Grapefruit Citrus Sweet Pineapple Tropical Fruity Tangy Sweet Citrus Orange,"Euphoria Happy Relaxing Euphoria Happy Relaxing Euphoric,Relaxed,Happy,Talkative,Uplifted",4.5,rainbow,,,,,,,,0.29,,,,,1.415,,0.0175,,1.105,0.99,,0.1275,0.8,,0.0,0.0,,,16.304000000000002,0.594,,,,0.11,0.102,0.125,,,0.2,0.48,0.065,,5.0,0.0,0.0

Though the identity of the original grower is still debated, at some point in the early 90s the cannabis lifestyle activists based in Luton calling themselves Exodus acquired some clones of Cheese and from there it rapidly became one of the most popular and sought after varieties in the UK.

Ushered in by a sweet herbal aroma, Jamaican Lion induces mild psychoactivity that carries through despite its low THC content. Sensory perception sharpens as bad moods dull in clear-headed sensations that can be described as simultaneously uplifting and calming. Few strains compare to Jamaican Lion as it eases pain, anxiety, and inflammation without intoxication or mental cloudiness.

Humboldt County, together with Mendocino and Trinity counties, is part of the famed Emerald Triangle, the largest cannabis-cultivating locale in America. No one seems to know exactly where Humboldt the strain came from, aside from the fact that its parents provided both indica and sativa genes. The high is focused more in the head than in the body, though physical sleepiness is a common effect. Expect creativity, euphoria, and a boost of happiness. Humboldt can be used to treat depression, headaches, anxiety, insomnia, and lack of appetite. Its CBD levels are apparently quite low, however, so this isn't the best option for treating conditions that respond to that chemical, including epilepsy and other seizure disorders. THC is known to be fairly abundant, with levels topping 16% in some tests. That doesn't put this strain on the highest shelf for potency fans, but it's a highly effective treatment option for many patients. The taste is earthy with floral notes, while the smell is pungent, sweet, and flowery. Humboldt is fairly easy to find up or down the West Coast, but elsewhere it's not as common.","The genetics of the Humboldt strain are something of a mystery, but it’s believed to be an Afghani strain that was cultivated in the Humboldt County area of California in the 1970s and later gained popularity in Europe in the 1990s. These plants are fast, tall growers that need lots of attention. Given proper care, they grow well indoors and out, flower in 8 weeks, and have above average yields.

The best bet is that THC is above average while CBD is scarce. Consult your budtender and doctor before using this as a sole treatment for epilepsy. Otherwise, it may be good for depression, anxiety, and everyday aches and pains. Those who report getting high off Kushage say it produces a giggly, happy euphoric effect with a tingling sensation.

The yield of crystals on the leaves is very high. Many users like LVPK because it helps to stimulate the mind. It helps with focus and improves creativity. It can make the body tingly, especially in the fingers and toes.

People with insomnia are advised not to use this strain since it will only keep them up longer. The base aroma is similar to diesel with only a slight lemon like undertone.

The high is mostly cerebral, suggesting a sativa tilt, though the exact ratio of sativa to indica is not widely known.

CBD levels are much harder to come by, though Colombian Gold has been used to crossbreed strains that are high in that cannabinoid. Still, without more reliable information, this strain shouldn't be used as the sole medication for conditions that respond to CBD, including seizure disorders.

Despite the unique method of smoking Thai Stick, it does have a fairly typical sativa high, although it can add a sense of clarity at times. The high starts slowly, infusing you with a growing sense of euphoria that eventually reaches its peak and leaves you feeling uplifted and slightly motivated. As your mind is boosted into complete happiness, your body will be washed over with a feeling of calming relaxation that doesn’t affect your ability to move but can leave you feeling exceptionally lazy.

Thai strains are pure sativa, with a 100:0 sativa/indica ratio and a typically potent cerebral high that adds pep to a busy day.

The head high is focused and energizing, powerful but calming, with strong euphoria and clear-headed effects. It's an upbeat strain, good for combatting fatigue, ADHD, and anxiety. Thai has a distinct lemon scent and flavor, with additional notes of wood and spice present in the aroma. The THC levels vary by location, breeder, and crop, but they can top 23% in some plants. CBD levels, on the other hand, are very low, typical for a sativa. There are few reports of negative effects, though dry mouth is always possible. Thai is most popular in the Pacific Northwest, and can also be found in California. Elsewhere, like most pure strains, it's scarce.","Thai refers to a cannabis variety that grows natively in Thailand and was brought to the U.S. in the 70s and 80s.

The buds are a light green color with occasional splotches of purple and a thick frosting of resinous trichomes. THC concentration is high in the strain, coming in at more than 21% in some tests.

It's best used at night, given its powerful sedative qualities and couch-lock effects. There are few reports of negative effects, but bloodshot eyes and dry mouth are probably most common.

Because of these potent well-balanced effects, Medusa is said to be ideal for treating insomnia, chronic pain, muscle spasms or tremors, and chronic stress or anxiety.

It began its journey from Holland in the early 1980s and made its way to the United States. It has grown immensely popular and is a cross between Hash Plant strains along with Northern Lights #1, or so they say. Each nugget holds a woody, earthy aroma, which is sweet at the same time. The smell can easily be identified but is not as potent as you would expect it to be. The strain has a spicy and delicious taste to it that will most definitely send a chill down your spine, out of excitement that is. The buds are tight and are completely covered by resin along with green leaves with red hairs. After smoking the strain, you will feel exceptionally relaxed. However, do not be surprised if you feel sleepy and are locked to your couch. What is really interesting about the strain is that it has numerous medical applications at the same time. Essentially, it is used by patients suffering from insomnia. But considering its pain fighting effects it can also be used to treat chronic pains, aches and even migraines if the situation demands it.","One of Sensi Seeds's classics, Hash Plant stays compact during her extra-short flowering time. Her tight, resin-drenched flower clusters develop a brittle surface when dried and give off a deep, rich Afghani aroma that’s undercut with a hint of hashish. When consumed, her dominant flavor is the spicy-sharp bite of smouldering resin glands. The instant vaporization of those layers of sparkling trichomes accelerates Hash Plant’s rapid, blissful and breathtakingly powerful body-stone. This 90% indica is the product of careful genetic selection, a process that involved matching the mysterious Hash Plant original from the U.S. with Northern Lights. ",,Kush Spicy Dank Hash Herbal Woody Earthy Spicy/Herbal Diesel,"Euphoria Happy Relaxing Sleepy Euphoria Happy Relaxing Sleepy Relaxed,Sleepy,Happy,Euphoric,Hungry",4.2,hash-plant,,,,,,,,0.13,,,,,0.7588888888888891,,0.16777777777777778,,0.8611111111111112,0.4033333333333334,,0.69,0.5444444444444445,,0.0,0.0,,,15.29090909090909,6.881818181818183,,,,0.3425,1.0100000000000002,0.17375000000000004,,,0.69,2.53,0.19142857142857148,,11.0,0.0,0.0

It is still more popular in the UK than anywhere else, although its fame has spread to many other parts of the world. English farmers created this strain by inbreeding Skunk #1, a sativa-dominant hybrid. UK Cheese itself is indica-dominant, with a sativa/indica ratio of 20:80, but the effects are balanced, delivering both a head and body high. It's a potent strain, with THC levels topping out at about 20%, and it's known to hit fast and hard. The effects are intensely euphoric, with an upbeat, happy mood, some laziness, and a dose of creativity. Best used to treat pain and stress, UK Cheese is also an effective way to alleviate insomnia and depression. CBD levels are low, less than 1%, so this isn't a good choice for patients with seizures or other disorders that respond to CBD. Cottonmouth and dry eyes are common side effects, and paranoia, headaches, and dizziness are also reported. Fittingly, this strain smells and tastes like cheese, with a pungent earthy aroma.","UK Cheese is a popular hybrid strain known for its potent, balanced effects and signature musty cheese smell. The flavor is also unique with notes of berries and spicy cheese (one that may just have to be tasted rather than described). This strain is thought to be a specific phenotype (same genetics, different end result) of Skunk #1 that was originally cultivated in the early 1990s by a UK collective group known as “Exodus.” (As a result, this strain is also known as Exodus Cheese.) UK Cheese became popular for its energetic, euphoric head effects combined with its impressive pain relief potential. It quickly spread beyond the borders of its British home. Most users experience alert, sativa effects that allow for mental relaxation without sedation, but it may hasten bedtime for some. Effects tend to be felt in the head first, generally around the eyes, then spread throughout the entire body, producing muscle relaxation and even some tingly numbness.

The effects are calming, euphoric, and happy, and come with a powerful case of the munchies.

Berry, earth, and grape are the dominant notes to the smell and taste of Platinum Purple Kush, while the nugs are large and leafy, light green, and purple with a platinum coating.

1856,sour-tsunami,hybrid,0.5,0.5,0.1,"The name of this increasingly popular medical choice refers not to the potency of its high but to the power of its symptom relief. Sour Tsunami has high CBD content, as high as 10% or even 11%, which makes it one of the most seizure-friendly medications on the market. THC levels, on the other hand, are quite low, usually less than 10%. That makes this a good choice for some children with severe epilepsy, as well as other patients whose conditions respond to CBD. A cross of Sour Diesel and NYC Diesel, this strain is a sativa-dominant hybrid with an unknown ratio of sativa to indica. Anyway, the genetic balance of Sour Tsunami is much less important to most patients than its high CBD content. This strain should be used to treat chronic pain, seizures, insomnia, and stress. It can also helps spur appetite in patients who need to eat more. Like its parents, Sour Tsunami has a sour flavor and smell with strong notes of diesel and earth. Though it's popular in California and Michigan, this strain is found mostly in the Pacific Northwest. It's hard to find on the black market.","Sour Tsunami is a strain that became famous for being one of the first to be specifically bred for high CBD rather than THC content. The result is a strain that’s effective at treating pain and inflammation without producing a significant “high” that is linked to high THC. Sour Tsunami CBD levels test as high as 10 or 11%, while THC is usually under 10%. Lawrence Ringo of the Southern Humboldt Seed Collective bred this strain over four years of hard work by crossing Sour Diesel plants with NYC Diesel.

1927,wookies,hybrid,,,,"Wookies (not to be confused with the strain “Wookie” or the enormous, sentient space-bears of Star Wars) is an indica-dominant cross of White 91 (The White x Chemdawg 91) and Girl Scout Cookies. Known for its loud terpene profile and high-THC percentage, Wookies grows the Cookies genetic line while standing firmly on its own in terms of effects. It combines the generous trichome production of White 91 with the minty, musky aroma of the GSC “Forum Cut” to create a strain that is potent and pleasing to the senses.    ",,,Menthol Earthy Pungent,"Happy,Relaxed,Euphoric,Uplifted,Focused",4.8,wookies,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,1.39,0.27,,0.44,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,,23.83,0.54,,,,,0.07,0.13,,,0.53,,0.03,,1.0,0.0,0.0
